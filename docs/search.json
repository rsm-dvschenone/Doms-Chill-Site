    "text": "Blueprinty is a small firm that makes software for developing blueprints specifically for submitting patent applications to the US patent office. Their marketing team would like to make the claim that patent applicants using Blueprinty’s software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved. Ideal data to study such an effect might include the success rate of patent applications before using Blueprinty’s software and after using it. Unfortunately, such data is not available.\nHowever, Blueprinty has collected data on 1,500 mature (non-startup) engineering firms. The data include each firm’s number of patents awarded over the last 5 years, regional location, age since incorporation, and whether or not the firm uses Blueprinty’s software. The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty’s software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 1500 entries, 0 to 1499\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------      --------------  -----  \n 0   patents     1500 non-null   int64  \n 1   region      1500 non-null   object \n 2   age         1500 non-null   float64\n 3   iscustomer  1500 non-null   int64  \n 4   age_std     1500 non-null   float64\n 5   age_sq_std  1500 non-null   float64\ndtypes: float64(3), int64(2), object(1)\nmemory usage: 70.4+ KB\n\n\n\n\nMean number of patents by customer status:\n iscustomer\n0    3.473013\n1    4.133056\nName: patents, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram Interpretation\n\n\n\nWe observe that customers tend to have a higher number of patents on average, and their distribution is right-skewed compared to non-customers.

We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\nLet ( Y_1, Y_2, , Y_n () ). The probability mass function is:\n[ f(Y_i ) = ]\nThen the likelihood function for a sample of size ( n ) is:\n[ (Y_1, , Y_n) = _{i=1}^{n} ]\nTaking the natural logarithm to get the log-likelihood:\n[ () = _{i=1}^{n} ( -+ Y_i - Y_i! ) ]\nThis is the log-likelihood expression we will use to estimate ( ) in our simple Poisson model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog-Likelihood Curve Interpretation\n\n\n\nThe log-likelihood curve reaches a clear peak, suggesting the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of ( ) lies around that peak.\nThis visual check helps confirm the function is well-behaved and the model is appropriate for estimating a central rate parameter from count data.\n\n\nWe start with the log-likelihood for ( n ) i.i.d. observations from a Poisson distribution:\n[ () = _{i=1}^{n} ( -+ Y_i - Y_i! ) ]\nTo find the MLE of ( ), we take the first derivative with respect to ( ):\n[ = {i=1}^{n} ( -1 + ) = -n + {i=1}^{n} Y_i ]\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for ( ):\n[ -n + {i=1}^{n} Y_i = 0 {i=1}^{n} Y_i = n = _{i=1}^{n} Y_i = {Y} ]\nThus, the MLE of ( ) is simply the sample mean ( {Y} ).\nThis makes intuitive sense, since the Poisson distribution has both its mean and variance equal to ( ).\n\n\nMLE of lambda (numerical optimization): 3.6847\nSample mean of Y: 3.6847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from Optimization\n\n\n\nUsing numerical optimization, the estimated MLE of ( ) is approximately {lambda_mle:.4f},\nwhich aligns closely with the sample mean ( {Y} = {sample_mean:.4f} ).\nThis matches our earlier mathematical derivation, confirming that the Poisson MLE for ( ) is the mean of the observed data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Log-Likelihood Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntodo: Use your function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates. Specifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable. Use the Hessian to find standard errors of the beta parameter estimates and present a table of coefficients and standard errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild the Design Matrix X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate 𝛽\n\n\n\n\n\n         Current function value: 3258.072145\n         Iterations: 18\n         Function evaluations: 252\n         Gradient evaluations: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting Coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

Key findings include:\n\nInstant bookable listings are significantly more likely to get reviews — suggesting ease of booking matters to users.\nLarger listings (more bedrooms) and cleanliness scores are also strong positive predictors.\nShared rooms have much fewer bookings than entire homes, and Private rooms also see reduced volume.\nHigher prices slightly reduce bookings, consistent with price sensitivity.\n“Value” and “location” scores were surprisingly negative, possibly reflecting underlying price or geography-related confounders.\n\nOverall, the model helps identify which listing attributes are associated with higher demand in NYC’s Airbnb market."

We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\nLet ( Y_1, Y_2, , Y_n () ). The probability mass function is:\n[ f(Y_i ) = ]\nThen the likelihood function for a sample of size ( n ) is:\n[ (Y_1, , Y_n) = _{i=1}^{n} ]\nTaking the natural logarithm to get the log-likelihood:\n[ () = _{i=1}^{n} ( -+ Y_i - Y_i! ) ]\nThis is the log-likelihood expression we will use to estimate ( ) in our simple Poisson model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog-Likelihood Curve Interpretation\n\n\n\nThe log-likelihood curve reaches a clear peak, suggesting the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of ( ) lies around that peak.\nThis visual check helps confirm the function is well-behaved and the model is appropriate for estimating a central rate parameter from count data.\n\n\nWe start with the log-likelihood for ( n ) i.i.d. observations from a Poisson distribution:\n[ () = _{i=1}^{n} ( -+ Y_i - Y_i! ) ]\nTo find the MLE of ( ), we take the first derivative with respect to ( ):\n[ = {i=1}^{n} ( -1 + ) = -n + {i=1}^{n} Y_i ]\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for ( ):\n[ -n + {i=1}^{n} Y_i = 0 {i=1}^{n} Y_i = n = _{i=1}^{n} Y_i = {Y} ]\nThus, the MLE of ( ) is simply the sample mean ( {Y} ).\nThis makes intuitive sense, since the Poisson distribution has both its mean and variance equal to ( ).\n\n\nMLE of lambda (numerical optimization): 3.6847\nSample mean of Y: 3.6847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from Optimization\n\n\n\nUsing numerical optimization, the estimated MLE of ( ) is approximately {lambda_mle:.4f},\nwhich aligns closely with the sample mean ( {Y} = {sample_mean:.4f} ).\nThis matches our earlier mathematical derivation, confirming that the Poisson MLE for ( ) is the mean of the observed data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Log-Likelihood Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntodo: Use your function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates. Specifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable. Use the Hessian to find standard errors of the beta parameter estimates and present a table of coefficients and standard errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild the Design Matrix X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate 𝛽\n\n\n\n\n\n         Current function value: 3258.072145\n         Iterations: 18\n         Function evaluations: 252\n         Gradient evaluations: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting Coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

Key findings include:\n\nInstant bookable listings are significantly more likely to get reviews — suggesting ease of booking matters to users.\nLarger listings (more bedrooms) and cleanliness scores are also strong positive predictors.\nShared rooms have much fewer bookings than entire homes, and Private rooms also see reduced volume.\nHigher prices slightly reduce bookings, consistent with price sensitivity.\n“Value” and “location” scores were surprisingly negative, possibly reflecting underlying price or geography-related confounders.\n\nOverall, the model helps identify which listing attributes are associated with higher demand in NYC’s Airbnb market."

Key findings include:\n\nInstant bookable listings are significantly more likely to get reviews — suggesting ease of booking matters to users.\nLarger listings (more bedrooms) and cleanliness scores are also strong positive predictors.\nShared rooms have much fewer bookings than entire homes, and Private rooms also see reduced volume.\nHigher prices slightly reduce bookings, consistent with price sensitivity.\n“Value” and “location” scores were surprisingly negative, possibly reflecting underlying price or geography-related confounders.\n\nOverall, the model helps identify which listing attributes are associated with higher demand in NYC’s Airbnb market."

randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\n\n#These are the variables that I am going to include\n#They are not outcome variables, so they will be good to use to test to see if the population distrbutions are significantly different:\n#mrm2 – months since last donation\n#hpa – highest previous amount donated\n#freq – number of prior donations\nfrom scipy.stats import t\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_ci(var,

in means on several baseline characteristics. The intervals for mrm2, hpa, and freq all include zero, suggesting that the groups were well-balanced and no statistically significant differences were present. This supports the validity of the random assignment.\n\n\nNow I will go on to see if the results from making a linear regression, for variable mrm2, will match that from that as the t-test @95% confidence\n\nfrom scipy.stats import t\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# --- T-Test (using classic formula) ---\na = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"mrm2\"].dropna()\nb = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"mrm2\"].dropna()\n\nmean_diff = a.mean() - b.mean()\nse = np.sqrt((a.var(ddof=1)/len(a)) + (b.var(ddof=1)/len(b)))\ndof = min(len(a), len(b)) - 1\nt_stat = mean_diff / se\n\nprint(f\"T-Test result for mrm2:\")\nprint(f\"  Mean difference: {mean_diff:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  SE: {se:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  t-stat: {t_stat:.4f}\")\n\n# --- Linear Regression ---\nmodel = smf.ols(\"mrm2 ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nLinear Regression result for mrm2:\")\nprint(model.summary())\n\nT-Test result for mrm2:\n  Mean difference: 0.0137\n  SE: 0.1145\n  t-stat: 0.1195\n\nLinear Regression result for mrm2:\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Both approaches yielded nearly identical estimates:\nMean difference: 0.0137\nStandard error: ~0.115\nt-statistic: 0.119\nThese consistent results confirm that a linear regression with a binary treatment variable is mathematically equivalent to a t-test. This approach mirrors the analysis used in Table 1 of Karlan and List (2007), which demonstrates the success of randomization in balancing observable characteristics across groups. ## Experimental Results\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Calculate mean donation rate by group\ndonation_rates = df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"gave\"].mean().reset_index()\ndonation_rates[\"group\"] = donation_rates[\"treatment\"].map({0: \"Control\", 1: \"Treatment\"})\n\n# Create barplot\nsns.barplot(data=donation_rates, x=\"group\", y=\"gave\")\nplt.title(\"Proportion of People Who Donated\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Proportion Donated\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Group\")\nplt.ylim(0, donation_rates[\"gave\"].max() + 0.01)\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# T-test: donation rates (binary outcome)\ngave_ttest = ttest_ind(df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"gave\"],\n                       df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"gave\"])\nprint(\"T-test result for 'gave' (donation made):\", gave_ttest)\n\n# Bivariate regression: gave ~ treatment\ngave_reg = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(gave_reg.summary())\n\nT-test result for 'gave' (donation made): TtestResult(statistic=3.101361000543946, pvalue=0.0019274025949016982, df=50081.0)\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The test yielded a statistically significant result (p = 0.0019), indicating that those who received the match offer were more likely to donate. While the absolute difference in rates is small (from ~1.8% to ~2.2%), the result is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This suggests that even modest behavioral nudges — such as the promise of a matched gift — can influence charitable giving. This supports the idea presented in Table 2a of Karlan and List (2007), where matched donations are shown to increase response rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbit Model Interpretation\n\n\n\nI used a probit regression to model the likelihood that a person made a charitable donation as a function of whether they were offered a matching donation. The coefficient on the treatment variable was positive and statistically significant (z = 3.11, p = 0.002), suggesting that individuals who received the matching offer were more likely to donate.\n\n\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Prepare data for probit\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])  # Add intercept\ny = df[\"gave\"]\n\n# Fit probit model\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

It’s a standard choice in applied microeconomics and matches the method used by Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\nAlthough the raw coefficient from a probit model isn’t directly interpretable as a probability, the significant result aligns with earlier t-tests and linear regression findings. This confirms that the treatment has a measurable effect on donation behavior. In essence, people respond to matching offers — even small nudges like this can meaningfully influence giving.\nI also took the liberty of calculating how much more likely someone is to donate because of the treatment, in percentage terms.\n\n# Get marginal effects\nmarginal_effects = probit_model.get_margeff()\nprint(marginal_effects.summary())\n\n       Probit Marginal Effects       \n=====================================\nDep.

While small, this is statistically significant and meaningful in a high-volume fundraising context.\nNOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions…\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch Ratio Interpretation (T-test + Regression)\n\n\n\nI conducted a series of t-tests to examine whether higher match ratios (2:1 and 3:1) led to higher donation rates compared to a 1:1 match. None of the comparisons were statistically significant. This aligns with the findings of Karlan and List (2007), who similarly reported that while matched donations increased giving compared to no match, larger match ratios did not consistently lead to higher response rates. This suggests that the presence of a match, rather than its magnitude, may be the primary behavioral driver.\n\n\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# 1:1 vs 2:1\ngave_1to1 = df[df[\"ratio\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ngave_2to1 = df[df[\"ratio\"] == 2][\"gave\"]\nttest_2vs1 = ttest_ind(gave_2to1, gave_1to1)\nprint(\"2:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\", ttest_2vs1)\n\n# 2:1 vs 3:1\ngave_3to1 = df[df[\"ratio\"] == 3][\"gave\"]\nttest_3vs2 = ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_2to1)\nprint(\"3:1 vs 2:1 match rate:\", ttest_3vs2)\n\n# (Optional) 1:1 vs 3:1\nttest_3vs1 = ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_1to1)\nprint(\"3:1 vs 1:1 match rate:\", ttest_3vs1)\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 match rate: TtestResult(statistic=0.96504713432247, pvalue=0.33453168549723933, df=22265.0)\n3:1 vs 2:1 match rate: TtestResult(statistic=0.05011583793874515, pvalue=0.9600305283739325, df=22261.0)\n3:1 vs 1:1 match rate: TtestResult(statistic=1.0150255853798622, pvalue=0.3101046637086672, df=22260.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Regression Might Reveal More\n\n\n\nThe regression model pools variance and uses all three match groups in one estimation, which can provide slightly more power than isolated pairwise t-tests.

The model uses the 1:1 match group as the baseline. Both the 2:1 and 3:1 match groups showed small but statistically significant increases in donation rates, around +0.36 to +0.37 percentage points. This contrasts slightly with the t-tests, which did not find significant differences — likely because the regression model uses more degrees of freedom and pools variance more efficiently.\nThe results suggest that larger match ratios may have had a small positive impact, though the effect size is modest. This provides slightly more evidence than Karlan and List (2007), who found no consistent effects. However, even in this case, the behavioral change is relatively small, supporting the idea that the presence of a match may matter more than its magnitude.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nBelow is the T-Test:\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# T-test comparing average donation amount (including 0s)\nt_amount = ttest_ind(df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"amount\"],\n                     df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"amount\"])\nprint(\"T-test on donation amount:\")\nprint(t_amount)\n\nT-test on donation amount:\nTtestResult(statistic=1.8605020225753781, pvalue=0.06282038947470686, df=50081.0)\n\n\nThe results of this indicate:\nNow I am running a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status.

Both a t-test and a linear regression yielded nearly identical results: treatment group participants donated about $0.15 more, but the difference was not statistically significant (p ≈ 0.063).

The results showed that donors in the treatment group gave, on average, $1.67 less than those in the control group. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.561). This suggests that while the match offer may have influenced the decision to donate, it did not affect how much was given among those who did donate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCausality Caveat\n\n\n\nThis regression is not strictly causal, because it conditions on having donated — which is a post-treatment outcome. That means you’re selecting a subset of people whose outcome (donating) may itself have been influenced by the treatment. This could introduce selection bias, so while the analysis is informative, it should be interpreted descriptively rather than causally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram Interpretation\n\n\n\nI created histograms of donation amounts among donors in both the treatment and control groups. Both groups show similar distributions, with most donations clustering around $25 to $75. The red line shows the mean donation, which is slightly higher in the control group. These visuals reinforce the regression results — while the treatment may have influenced donation likelihood, it did not lead to higher amounts among those who gave.\n\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Filter to donors only\ndonors = df[df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0]\n\n# --- Histogram for Treatment Group ---\nsns.histplot(data=donors[donors[\"treatment\"] == 1], x=\"amount\", bins=30, kde=False)\nplt.axvline(donors[donors[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"amount\"].mean(), color='red', linestyle='--', label=\"Mean\")\nplt.title(\"Donation Amounts – Treatment Group\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n# --- Histogram for Control Group ---\nsns.histplot(data=donors[donors[\"treatment\"] == 0], x=\"amount\", bins=30, kde=False)\nplt.axvline(donors[donors[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"amount\"].mean(), color='red', linestyle='--', label=\"Mean\")\nplt.title(\"Donation Amounts – Control Group\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()"

For simplicity, there is not a “no choice” option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives.\nEach alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from $4 to $32 in increments of $4.\nThe part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer \\(i\\) for hypothethical streaming service \\(j\\) is\n\\[\nu_{ij} = (1 \\times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \\times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\\times Price_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere the variables are binary indicators and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.\nThe following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\n# Define attributes\nbrands = [\"N\", \"P\", \"H\"]  # Netflix, Prime, Hulu\nads = [\"Yes\", \"No\"]\nprices = np.arange(8, 33, 4)\n\n# Generate all possible profiles\nprofiles = pd.DataFrame([(b, a, p) for b in brands for a in ads for p in prices],\n                        columns=[\"brand\", \"ad\", \"price\"])\n\n# Utility functions\nb_util = {\"N\": 1.0, \"P\": 0.5, \"H\": 0.0}\na_util = {\"Yes\": -0.8, \"No\": 0.0}\np_util = lambda p: -0.1 * p\n\n# Simulation parameters\nn_peeps = 100\nn_tasks = 10\nn_alts = 3\n\n# Simulate one respondent\ndef sim_one(id):\n    datlist = []\n    for t in range(1, n_tasks + 1):\n        sampled = profiles.sample(n=n_alts, replace=False).copy()\n        sampled.insert(0, \"task\", t)\n        sampled.insert(0, \"resp\", id)\n        sampled[\"v\"] = (\n            sampled[\"brand\"].map(b_util) +\n            sampled[\"ad\"].map(a_util) +\n            p_util(sampled[\"price\"])\n        ).round(10)\n        sampled[\"e\"] = -np.log(-np.log(np.random.rand(n_alts)))\n        sampled[\"u\"] = sampled[\"v\"] + sampled[\"e\"]\n        sampled[\"choice\"] = (sampled[\"u\"] == sampled[\"u\"].max()).astype(int)\n        datlist.append(sampled)\n    return pd.concat(datlist, ignore_index=True)\n\n# Generate data\nconjoint_data = pd.concat([sim_one(i) for i in range(1, n_peeps + 1)], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Keep only observable variables\nconjoint_data = conjoint_data[[\"resp\", \"task\", \"brand\", \"ad\", \"price\", \"choice\"]]"

    "text": "3. Preparing the Data for Estimation\nThe “hard part” of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps. In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.\nTo prepare the data: - We created dummy variables for the brand attribute. Specifically, we included binary indicators for Netflix and Prime Video, using Hulu as the baseline. - The ad feature was converted into a binary variable, where 1 indicates the presence of ads and 0 indicates an ad-free option. - We retained the price and choice columns in their original form.\nBelow is the Python code used for data preprocessing. The previewed table shows that each row corresponds to one product alternative shown in a choice task.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Loading and and preprocessing of  data\ndf = pd.read_csv('conjoint_data.csv')\ndf = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=[\"brand\"], drop_first=True)\ndf[\"ad\"] = df[\"ad\"].map({\"Yes\": 1, \"No\": 0})\ndf.rename(columns={\"brand_N\": \"netflix\", \"brand_P\": \"prime\"}, inplace=True)\ndf.head()\n\n# Create design matrix and response vector\n\nX_columns = [\"netflix\", \"prime\", \"ad\", \"price\"]\nX = df[X_columns].values\ny = df[\"choice\"].values\ndf[\"choice_set\"] = df[\"resp\"].astype(str) + \"_\" + df[\"task\"].astype(str)\nchoice_sets = df[\"choice_set\"].values"

Take 11,000 steps and throw away the first 1,000, retaining the subsequent 10,000.\nhint: Use N(0,5) priors for the betas on the binary variables, and a N(0,1) prior for the price beta.\n_hint: instead of calculating post=lik*prior, you can work in the log-space and calculate log-post = log-lik + log-prior (this should enable you to re-use your log-likelihood function from the MLE section just above)_\nhint: King Markov (in the video) use a candidate distribution of a coin flip to decide whether to move left or right among his islands. Unlike King Markov, we have 4 dimensions (because we have 4 betas) and our dimensions are continuous. So, use a multivariate normal distribution to pospose the next location for the algorithm to move to. I recommend a MNV(mu, Sigma) where mu=c(0,0,0,0) and sigma has diagonal values c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005) and zeros on the off-diagonal. Since this MVN has no covariances, you can sample each dimension independently (so 4 univariate normals instead of 1 multivariate normal), where the first 3 univariate normals are N(0,0.05) and the last one if N(0,0.005).\ntodo: for at least one of the 4 parameters, show the trace plot of the algorithm, as well as the histogram of the posterior distribution.\ntodo: report the 4 posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals and compare them to your results from the Maximum Likelihood approach."
